### SOFTDES README temporary location
This is the code location for our update of the previous CabinComputer code! As soon as we make permanent changes to the repo, we will
begin removing previous code from this location (there is another repo that contains previous code in case of catastrophe).

As of right now, we think that we may have found a few of the issues the 2018 code had, so we may be able to implement a better
active time system, fix the TTS system, and fix the GPS location system without having to go back to the 2017 code. Our plan is to remove
several classes entirely too (we don't want our boats to communicate with each other anymore, want to get polished code that allows boats
to interact with buoys instead).

We have also decided to restart the code, using the current code for reference! This seems like the easiest way to simplify things, because there are so many nested classes that can't easily be unnested.
